## Introduction

An open python library for researchers and developers to generate GradCAM explanations for the tensorflow CNN models. 

Other popular python ML frameworks will soon be supported by the cnn-cam library

### Install

The below instructions assume you already have `pip` installed and exposed to the python environment where you want to run `cnncam`. 
Official instructions for installing `pip` can be found [here](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/)

Run the below pip command in a shell of your choice. 
```
pip install cnncam
```

### Demo

```python
from cnncam import GradCAM
from keras.applica

```


See `/examples` for executable examples, including an application of our implementation of GradCAM on VGG-16 with the ower of this repo's very cute cat, meso.
